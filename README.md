# Kinetis KL2 Development Board
### Kevin Cuzner

## Objective

Create a development board for a bare-metal ARM Microcontroller with minimal
parts while allowing for maximum prototypability.

## Purpose

To learn from hard experience what exactly is needed to implement from the
ground up a platform using an ARM-based microcontroller

## Idea

The board will have the following:

 * The Freescale MKL26Z32VFM4 48Mhz ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller, 32QFN (5mm)
 * Any needed support componenets
 * A DIP-compatible footprint. The goal is to be near the size of a teensy.

The goals are as follows:

 * $10 price point
    * $2.72 for the uC
    * $5 board
    * $3 supporting components
        * Perhaps a USB port even
 * Easy to construct with sufficient SMD soldering skill
 * We will produce 3 of them
    * 1 practice, 2 assembled on camera
